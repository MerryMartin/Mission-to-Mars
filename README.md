# Mission-to-Mars


## Project Overview

For this project, I am working with a data analyst named Robin to help Space Forward collect information about the climate of Mars.  I used Splinter and BeautifulSoup to visit and scrape data from two Mars websites.  I then used Pandas to store and analyze the data and Matplotlib to visualize the results.   

## Results
* There are 1867 Martian days' worth of data that I analyzed.  
* According to this data, there are 12 months in a Martian year.
 




### Average Temperature Per Month:
* On average, month 3 has the lowest temperature and month 8 has the highest temperature.

### Average Atmospheric Pressure Per Month:
* On average, month 6 has the lowest atmospheric pressure and month 9 has the highest atmospheric pressure.

### Martian Days Between Max Solar Longitudes: 
* There are 687 terrestrial (Earth) days in between solar longitudinal peaks for Mars.  Since Mars reaches its' max solar longitude once per year, there are 687 terrestrial (Earth) days in a Martian year.
